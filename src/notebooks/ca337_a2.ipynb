With that in hand, director Parker Finn plays on the idea that most people who suffer through awful events in life will have their past consume them if they don't confront them. Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is a clinical psychologist who surrounds herself with the mentally broken people of New Jersey (add your own joke here). You can basically connect the dots as to how she became good at her job. One fateful day a girl comes into her office and gruesomely ends her own life. That launches Sosie's journey into her own madness. Slowly seeing things in her life. Or being haunted by voices of her past. Whatever it is knows her greatest pains. And exploits it. The mystery isn't completely satisfying to solve, but the constant moments of jerky jumpscares definitely make you feel on edge.What I particularly like is the uneasy camera work. It isn't afraid to linger long within the frame. Nor add dutch angles. It plays like 70's cinema. The frames make you squirm. Though much of the scares are telegraphed. This isn't a slasher gory flick. It's really a psychological mind bender. As mentioned before, the resolution won't make you happy. But then, it really is watching someone work through their own mental illness. If that is interesting to you, this is the movie for you.\", \"Given its premise that appears purely silly and gimmicky on the surface, I was shocked that I actually got psychologically wrapped up in the allegorical themes and characterization of Smile.\",\"My assumptions for this film was that it would be repetitive with a bunch of cheap jump scares, and a story that would be a whirlwind of boredom. Almost similar to Truth or Dare.While this film was filled with a bunch of jump scares. They were executed in such a way that my anxiety was shooting through the roof. While Barbarian was able to spook me a bit. This film has my heart still racing an hour after the film has ended which is very uncommon for me.\", \"A horrifying look into trauma\", \"Going into this movie based on the trailer I kinda knew what I was getting myself into...but it was so much more than that! The storyline was very well drawn out...the jump scares were terrific. There may have been one too many...but hey...what's a gory horror movie without unexpected, uneccesary jump scares\", \"I wasn't scared during this film at all this is not a horror\", \"I literally laughed through-out this film not scary at all\", \"All the usual suspects are here again.
